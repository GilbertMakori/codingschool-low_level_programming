# 0x1A. C - Sorting algorithms & Big O
---
## Description

This project in the Low Level Programming series is about:
* At least four different sorting algorithms
* What is the Big O notation, and how to evaluate the time complexity of an algorithm
* How to select the best sorting algorithm for a given input
* What is a stable sorting algorithm

## Files

0x1A-sorting_algorithms | Main C files with all sorting algorithms and answers to big O notation to each sorting algorithm

## How to compile
gcc 4.8.4 using the flags -Wall -Werror -Wextra and -pedantic

## More Info
All files is formatted Betty style and checked using betty-style.pl and betty-doc.pl
All header files is guarded
