# 0x1C. C - Binary trees
---
## Description

This project in the Low Level Programming series is about:
* Binary Tree, Binary Search Tree, AVL Tree, Tree traversal and algorithms
* What is the difference between a binary tree and a Binary Search Tree
* What is the possible gain in terms of time complexity compared to linked lists
* What are the depth, the height, the size of a binary tree
* What are the different traversal methods to go through a binary tree
* What is a complete, a full, a perfect, a balanced binary tree
